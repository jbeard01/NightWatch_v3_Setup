Installing NightWatch test Framework

Not required, but recommended:

VSCode ([installer](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

Homebrew ([how to install](https://brew.sh/))

Install local dependencies:

Node.js

Download the macOS Installer directly from the http://nodejs.org  web site.

      If you want to download the package with terminal:

      curl "https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/node-${VERSION:-$(wget -qO- Index of /dist/latest/  | sed -nE 's|.*>node-(.*)\.pkg</a>.*|\1|p')}.pkg" > "$HOME/Downloads/node-latest.pkg" && sudo installer -store -pkg "$HOME/Downloads/node-latest.pkg" -target "/"

Alternatives

Using Homebrew:

      brew install node

Java ([Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17))

Verify Java is already installed by opening bash or terminal window and running this command `java -version`. If installed, Java version will be displayed

in terminal type the following command: `which java` and the path for its location will be displayed

If not already installed:

Navigate to Download the Latest Java LTS Free  and download the latest version

Set/Verify JAVA_HOME path in .zshrc or .bash_profile (note since OS Catalina zsh is the default terminal)

 

In a terminal: set java home paths, something like this example

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/bin

export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

then open your .zshrc and verify the path has been set 
 - NOTE: you may need to create a new .zshrc profile
if so:

`touch .zshrc` to create a new profile.

 

Use the following command to open your profile in textedit from command line:

`open -e .zshrc`

paste these paths:

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/bin
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

Save the file

Quit your terminal and reopen
